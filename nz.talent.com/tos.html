                <div class="c-section__text">        When this policy mentions “TALENT.COM,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to TALENT.COM INC., the Canadian-based company in charge of collecting, handling, and processing your information. TALENT.COM INC is a job aggregator that indexes all jobs available online so you can find every job listed online on one single website.       </div>

                <div class="c-section__text">        In order for us to better serve our visitors and users (“you”), there are two categories of information we collect:         </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle">1.1 <b>Long-term Data</b>        </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          “Long-term Data” refers to any data we collect to offer you a better job seeking and application experience. “Long-term Data” includes the following:      </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          <b>Account Creation.</b> When you apply for a job through TALENT.COM's platform, we save your first name, last name, email address, cover letter, and last uploaded resume (i.e. most recently uploaded attachment) and associate it with an Account, so you can easily apply for subsequent jobs without having to re-enter your application information every time.      </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          Should you choose not to upload your resume, you might be asked to give more information on your work experience, education, certifications/licenses and skills, among others. In most cases, providing this information is not required for you to apply, which is why you are free to choose whether to give it or not. If you do, this information will also be associated with your Account, so you can easily apply for subsequent jobs without having to re-enter your application information every time. If you choose not to share this information, you can, in most cases, proceed to applying for the job. However, there are some cases where work experience, education, certifications/licenses and skills, among others, may be required by the employer, in order for them to make hiring decisions. In those specific cases, choosing not to give this information will prevent you from applying for the job.</div>

                <div class="c-section__text">          We also collect your job search history (jobs viewed, jobs added to favorites, jobs applied for, keywords and location typed in the search bar) to give you better and more personalized results so that you are able to find jobs you are interested in faster and easier.    </div>

                <div class="c-section__text">        In order to keep you logged into your account as you navigate our website, we also collect and store cookies that are purged the second you log out.          </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        <b>Email Alerts.</b> When you subscribe to TALENT.COM INC’s Email Alerts service (also commonly referred to as “Job Alerts”), we collect your email address, as well as the keyword(s) and location typed in the search bar or displayed on the job posting from which you subscribed to email alerts. That way, we can email you personalized and relevant job listings related to your job search.    </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        Please note that you may manage your alerts or unsubscribe at any given time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe from Job Alert” link at the bottom of any email alert. You can then click on the “Delete” button next to the alert you wish to remove.          </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        <b>Traffic Quality.</b> We collect IP addresses and information on the device, operating system, and browser used to access our jobs. This information is stored separately from all other information and is anonymized in a way that it cannot be tied to any other information that can be used to identify you as an individual. This helps us guarantee that our traffic is genuine and acts as proof that real people click on our jobs—not robots.        </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        <b>Salary.</b> When applying for jobs, you may be asked about your current and desired salary. This information will never get automatically transmitted to employers, unless it is part of the “Short-Term Data” required by employers. Providing this information is not mandatory, but if you choose to do so, our Hiring Specialists will be able to access this data and can use it to help you negotiate your salary with employers interested in your profile. However, you should know that Hiring Specialists usually get in touch with you prior to discussing your profile with the employer.          </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        The main purpose of asking for Salary information is to better tailor the content we are showing and sending you. You can read more about Content Customization in section 2 (“HOW WE USE INFORMATION”).     </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle">1.2 <b>Short-term Data</b>        </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          "Short-Term Data" refers to any information that is requested by an employer in order for a job seeker to successfully apply for the employer's job, aside from the information already mentioned above in the "Long-Term Data" section.       </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          Some of the most common examples of “Short-term Data” are level of proficiency with certain programs; level of fluency with certain spoken or written languages; other skill assessments; or external links, such as portfolio links.       </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          When you apply for jobs and submit your application to employers directly through TALENT.COM INC, we act as an intermediary between you and the employer. We collect this data temporarily in order to automatically transmit it to the employer on your behalf.       </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle">1.2.1 <b>Important Notice</b>          </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">            Once an application is transmitted to an employer, TALENT.COM INC cannot reverse the process or retrieve any data that was already transmitted to the employer’s end.           </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">            When you apply to a job using TALENT.COM INC, you understand and agree that your application information is sent to the employer and that once your application is transmitted, the process cannot be undone since a copy of your information will already have reached the employer’s end.         </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle"> 2. <b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</b>        </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        <b>Content Customization.</b> We use the information we collect to provide a personalized, simplified job seeking and application experience, whether it is showing you job listings tailored to your needs, sending you customized email alerts, or offering you a one-stop platform where you can apply to all the jobs you are interested in with your application data being automatically and transparently transmitted to the employers.  </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        <b>More Job Opportunities.</b> We use your application information to provide you with job opportunities you may have missed or that have not been shared with the rest of our users. Our Hiring Specialists are always looking for outstanding candidates, so, if your profile matches an employer’s requirement, we will reach out to let you know. Please, know that prior to contacting you, our Hiring Specialists may review your application information – including your resume if you chose to attach one – in order for them to determine whether you would be a good fit for the role. </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        <b>Services Improvement.</b> We use an anonymized version of your IP address to see how different users interact with our services so that we can better improve them.   </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle">2.1 <b>How long we keep your information</b>            </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          “Long-term Data” (see 1.1) is stored in our system for as long as we need it to successfully provide our services—or until you wish to purge it (see 5.3). For example, in the case of Email Alerts, we need to store your email address so that we are able to send you the alerts you have subscribed to. You can access, manage, and purge “Long-term Data” by logging into your TALENT.COM account (see 6.1).           </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          “Short-term Data” (see 1.2) is stored in our system as long as employers need access to it. We keep it in case the transmission of your information to the employer has failed and we need to retransmit it to them. You may also purge your “Short-term Data” at any time by logging into your TALENT.COM account (see 6.1).         </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          Please, know that as long as you have a TALENT.COM account, we assume you keep applying for jobs or will do so in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we keep your information available to keep you from re-entering it manually the next time you choose to apply.         </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle"> 2.2 <b>How your information is stored</b>        </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">          Information we collect is transferred to, processed, and stored in Canada. The protection of your privacy and personal information is important to us. TALENT.COM INC is committed to handling and processing your data in the most secure way and places great importance on the way your information is being handled and processed. We have a team assigned on all data security matters and are continuously working on new features to keep your information secure.    </div>

                <div class="c-section__text">        We only disclose the information we collect from you as described below:   </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        We may share your anonymized IP address to our partners or clients, but  we never pair it with “Long-term Data” or “Short-term Data”. The reason why we share this information with our partners is for traffic quality assurance. This information acts as proof that real people click on their content—not robots.             </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        When applying for a job, we ask you for your consent before we can share your application information with the employer who posted the job you are applying for. If you proceed to apply to the job, you understand that your application information will be submitted to the employer and that, as detailed in 1.2.1, this process cannot be reversed.    </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        We will never sell any of your information to advertisers or third parties.              </div>

                <div class="c-section__text">    Our policies are in place to help ensure a positive experience for all parties involved in our Publisher and API programs. All publishers are required to adhere to the following terms. If you, as a publisher, fail to comply with any of these terms without permission from TALENT.COM INC, we reserve the right to suspend and close your account and cancel any scheduled payments immediately without further notice or official notification. Once your account is disabled, you may not be eligible for further participation in our publisher program.     </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">    Because our policies are subject to change at any time, please check the current page for update. It is your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies listed here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from TALENT.COM INC.     </div>

                <div class="c-section__subtitle"> 1. What does a publisher do?              </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        Publishers are third-party entities from whom TALENT.COM INC buys traffic, as part of our traffic acquisition strategy. They publish our content on their website and send their visitors to our pages in exchange for a click-based rate which may vary depending on numerous factors, including the publisher’s country or exposure.           </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        Our relationship with publishers is primarily a partnership, meaning all parties involved shall benefit from it. Publishers must guarantee that they will bring quality traffic to our website, meaning all users browsing their websites must show genuine interest when clicking on our links and, hence, must agree to being redirected on our website and browse our content. Any publisher that does not follow these guidelines may be exposed to severe consequences, such as account cancellation or disabling.     </div>
                <div class="c-section__subtitle"> 2. Invalid and misleading traffic: what is it and how do we prevent it?           </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        TALENT.COM INC treats policy violations and invalid traffic very seriously in order to protect job seekers, publishers, and advertisers. We pay close attention to traffic behavior by analyzing all clicks to determine whether they fit a pattern of use that might artificially drive up an advertiser’s costs or a publisher’s earnings.         </div>
                <div class="c-section__text">        More specifically, we sample part of the traffic to measure what we call “Intent of Apply” (IOA) which corresponds to the percentage of people who show genuine interest in applying on a given job. This is the most accurate indicator of users’ IOA as it requires them to fill out a quick form, showing they are interested in applying for the job they are reading about. The industry average is 10%, meaning for every 100 visitors, 10 are usually willing to fill the form in order to access the employer’s website. If a publisher’s IOA rate goes under a certain percentage, it triggers a quality assurance (QA) process, where we look for any invalid or misleading traffic sources, such as:         </div>
